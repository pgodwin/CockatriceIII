This is the long lost vc5opti which should optimize output from Visual C++ 5.0 and 5.0.  It sits between Visual C++ and MASM.

I haven't tested it out yet.

I have found out from looking that the optimization program for GCC doesn't do anything and I wonder with modern compilers if it's even needed.  But I'm not going to throw this one out.
