BASILISK II INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

System Requirements
-------------------

To use Basilisk II, you need either a 512K Mac Classic ROM image or a
512K or 1MB 32-bit clean Macintosh ROM image. You also need a copy of MacOS
(0.x thru 7.5 for Classic emulation, 7.x or 8.0/8.1 for Mac II emulation).
For copyright reasons, none of these items are included with Basilisk II.
MacOS 7.5.3 and earlier versions can be downloaded from Apple and various
other Internet sites. Mac ROM files are not freely available. You have to
own a real Mac and read out its ROM. No, I don't know where you can download
ROM files. No, I won't send you one.

Depending on the platform you use, Basilisk II has additional requirements:

BeOS:
  You need BeOS R4 or better. On a PowerPC system you also need the
  "sheep" driver that comes with SheepShaver. To use Ethernet, you need
  the "sheep_net" add-on that also comes with SheepShaver (both items
  are included in the SheepShaver Trial Versions). The PowerPC version of
  Basilisk II cannot do Mac Classic emulation.

Unix:
  You need X11R6, pthreads support and GNU make. To use the GUI preferences
  editor, you also need GTK+ version 1.2 or better. On Linux, you need
  glibc 2.0 or better.

AmigaOS:
  You need at least a 68020 and AmigaOS 3.0 or better. To get the GUI
  preferences editor, you need gtlayout.library V39 or later. To get sound
  output, you need AHI V2 or later. Both items can be found on Aminet. You
  also need the "PrepareEmul" utility that somes with ShapeShifter (or any
  equivalent PrepareEmul substitute). The AmigaOS version of Basilisk II
  cannot do Mac Classic emulation.

Windows:
  You need at least Windows NT 4.0. Windows 95 and 98 can be used too, with a
  somewhat reduced set of features. Basilisk II supports DirectX version 5 or
  later, but version 3 may also work, depending on your graphics card.


Installation
------------

BeOS:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for BeOS, there are
  executables for BeOS/PPC and/or BeOS/x86 included. If you have the source
  distribution, do the following:

    cd src/BeOS
    make

  This will produce an executable "BasiliskII" in the "obj.ppc" or "obj.x86"
  directory. Basilisk II cannot run concurrently with SheepShaver. Trying to
  do so will crash Basilisk II, or SheepShaver, or both. On a PowerPC system
  you must have installed the "sheep" driver that comes with SheepShaver. To
  use Ethernet, you must have installed the "sheep_net" add-on that also comes
  with SheepShaver 

Unix:
  To compile Basilisk II, do the following:

    cd src/Unix
    ./configure
    make            [or "gmake" if you have GNU make and "make" fails]
    make install    [optionally]

  To use Ethernet networking under Linux, you either have to configure your
  kernel for ethertap support or make and install the "sheep_net" driver:

    make modules

  This should produce a kernel module "sheep_net.o" in the "Linux/NetDriver"
  directory. Now su root and say

    cd Linux/NetDriver
    make dev
    /sbin/insmod sheep_net.o

  This will install the device node "/dev/sheep_net" and load the driver.
  You should give appropriate access rights to /dev/sheep_net if you don't
  want to have to run Basilisk II as root.

  This is what Brian J. Johnson says about compiling for IRIX:
   "I recommend compiling with "-Ofast".  This requires changing "-g"
    to "-Ofast" in the Makefile, and adding "-ipa" to LDFLAGS.  This
    turns on massive interprocedural optimization, and makes for much
    better performance."

AmigaOS:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for AmigaOS, there is an
  executable included. You must also have the "PrepareEmul" utility installed
  that comes with ShapeShifter (or any equivalent PrepareEmul substitute,
  see the ShapeShifter docs). If you have the source distribution, do the
  following:

    cd src/AmigaOS
    smake

  To recompile Basilisk II, you need SAS/C 6.58. Earlier versions may not work.

Windows NT:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for Windows, there is a
  Windows NT binary included. To access CD-ROMs under Windows NT, the driver
  "cdenable.sys" must be copied to your "\WinNT\System32\drivers" directory.
  To access CD-ROMs under Windows 9x, the driver "cdenable.vxd" must be copied
  to the "\Windows\System" directory. To recompile Basilisk II, you need
  MS Visual V++ 5.0 or later. Symantec C++ should work, too, with some
  modifications. See the "sysdeps.h" file in the "Windows" directory.

The ROM file has to be named "ROM" and put in the same directory as the
Basilisk II executable but you can specify a different location for the ROM
file with the "rom" option in the preferences file (or with the preferences
GUI).
