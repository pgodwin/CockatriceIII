Bugs:
- System 7.1 with Quadra900 ModelID (1MB ROM): 0x108 gets strange value
- Strange things happen when the Mac ROM is lower in memory than the RAM
- Something still seems to be wrong with the UAE FPU (Calculator and scroll
  bars in MacOS 8 don't work properly)

General:
- Sony: rdVerify, Tag Buffer, DskErr
- Disk: rdVerify
- CD-ROM: track lists, positioning type 3, TOC type 4/5, ReadHeader/ReadMCN/
  ReadISRC/ReadAudio/ReadAllSubcodes
- Sound output rate/bits/channels switching
- Sound in
- Video: gamma tables, resolution/depth switching, multiple monitor support
- Double mouse pointer in window mode (should be fixed by blanking the
  Mac mouse pointer because the host mouse position is more accurate)
- More accurate Time Manager
- Serial driver: XOn/XOff handshaking
- regs.spcflags in UAE CPU should be handled atomically
- Classic ROM: mouse button/movement is broken with ROM mouse handler
- Classic ROM: sound output
- Write a nice User's Manual with linuxdoc or something similar

AmigaOS:
- "Create Hardfile..." button
- Mouse pointer in window mode
- Support for ShapeShifter External Video Drivers
- Direct SCSI transfers, i.e. no buffering for contiguous transfers (can't check if the device
  supports that); buffer is always in Chip memory now
- Preemptive threads don't work?
- clip_amiga.cpp: clip AmigaOS->Basilisk
- sys_amiga.cpp: MaxTransfer/BufMemType/TransferMask, SysAddCDROMPrefs(), SysFormat()
- sony.cpp: DISK_INSERT_CHECK: disks are not ejected and automatically remounted on eject
- Patch 512K ROM for 68040/060 caches
- Input handler instead of IDCMP?
- Last sound buffer is not played

BeOS:
- clip_beos.cpp: clip BeOS->Basilisk
- Last sound buffer is not played

Unix:
- clip_unix.cpp: clip Unix->Basilisk
- sys_unix.cpp: SysFormat(), SysIsFixedDisk(), SysIsDiskInserted(), prevent/allow for
  non-floppy/CDROM devices
- scsi_linux.cpp: adapt to SCSI Generic driver V2.0
